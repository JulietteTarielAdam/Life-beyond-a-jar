# Data description

The data are stored in a file called "Master" in CSV format used for the analysis and in a file called "Master-excel" in Excel format. They contain the following variables:

- `Fish` Name of the fish (Dragon, Elf, Fairy, Ghost, Goblin, Kinara, Kraken, Merlion, Naga, Orange Pendek, Pegasus, Phoenix or Wizard)
- `Tank` Tank in which the fish was during the trial (Jar, Small, Medium, Large or Barren)
- `Order` Order of rotation of the fish between tanks (1, 2, 3, 4 or 5)
- `Time` Time of day of the trial (7:00 AM, 10:00 AM, 2:00 PM or 6:00 PM)
- `Filter` Whether a filter was present in the tank 
- `Up/Down` Whether the behaviour(s) were performed on the upper or lower half of the tank
- `Resting` Time the fish spent resting in seconds
- `Resting place` Place where the fish rested (Filter, Floor, Inside barrel, On or against barrel, Plant leaves, Surface, Surface against plant, Under or against plant or N/A)
- `Hovering` Time the fish spent hovering in seconds
- `Hovering place` Place where the fish hovered (Above ground, Inside barrel, Just under surface, Just under surface (under bubble nest) or Mid water column)
- `Sinking/Floating` Time the fish spent sinking or floating
- `Transition type` XXXXX
- `Swimming` Time the fish spent swimming in seconds
- `Stereotypic swimming` Time the fish spent stereotypic swimming in seconds
- `Stereotypic swimming group/batch` This column is used to identify stereotypic swimming times that belong to the same stereotypic swimming event. Since time spent stereotypic swimming was recorded separately depending on whether it occurred in the upper or lower half of the tank, a single event could be split across multiple rows. This column helps link those times to the same event batch.
- `Stereotypic swimming type` Type of stereotypic swimming (Circles, Pace then hover, Pacing, Pacing front wall, Pacing with a hover or Zig zag)
- `Stereotypic swimming place` Place where the fish did stereotypic swimming (Back wall, Behind barrel, Corner, Front wall, Middle tank, Side tank, Side wall or Unsure)
- `Stereotypic swimming number of repetitions` Number of individual stereotypic swimming bouts (e.g. how many circles the fish did)
- `Interaction with surface` Time the fish spent interacting with the ground or side walls in seconds 
- `Interaction with surface type` Type of interaction (Aggressive bite wall, Aggressive fold into ground/scraped side, Aggressive ground, Aggressive head into surface, Aggressive plant, Aggressive swim up and down side (see reflection?), Aggressive thrash in surface, Aggressive wall, Bite ground, Bite surface, Fold into ground/scraped side, Head into surface, Head into surface (see reflection?), Head into surface and down, Head into surface and slide up, Head shake/swim into corner, Head shake/swim into corner then up, Head shake/swim into wall, Head shake/swim into wall (see reflection?), Head shake/swim into wall and pebbles, Nipping wall, Swim up and down side (see reflection?) or Swimming along side wall with contact)
- `Out of view` Time the fish was out of view of the human observer
- `Nest building` Time the fish spent building a nest
- `Foraging` Time the fish spent foraging

The complexity of the data file arises because a single trial can span multiple rows. Different behaviors were recorded within the same row (e.g., time spent swimming and time spent hovering). However, a new row was created if the fish repeated a similar behavior that had already been recorded (e.g., if the fish started swimming again after previously swimming and then hovering).

# Script description

+ ðŸ“„ `Load-data.R` is:
    - uploading packages
    - transforming the raw data in the data used for analysis. It concatenates times spent doing the same behaviour so each row corresponds to one unique trial with the total time spent doing each behaviour. It get rids of unused columns
    - concatenating hovering place and resting places into fewer categories. 

## Functions

+ ðŸ“„ `Linear-model.R` contains functions used for providing diagnostic and contrats of the linear models on each behaviour
+ ðŸ“„ `Plots.R` contains functions used to generate the plots for the different behaviours.
